\title{Read Data from a Paradox File}
\usage{
pxlib_get_data(pxdoc)
}
\arguments{
\item{pxdoc}{An object of class \code{pxdoc_t}, representing an open Paradox file
connection. This object is obtained from \code{pxlib_open_file()}.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} containing the data from the Paradox file. Each row
represents a record and each column represents a field. If the file contains
no records, an empty tibble is returned.
}
\description{
Retrieves all records from an open Paradox database file and returns them
as a tibble, ready for use in R.
}
\details{
This function provides a high-level interface for reading Paradox data.
The heavy lifting is done by a C-level function (\code{R_pxlib_get_data}) which
efficiently reads the raw data into memory. This R function then acts as a
wrapper to perform crucial post-processing steps:
\itemize{
\item It identifies columns containing binary (BLOB) data and correctly
converts them into \code{blob} objects.
\item It ensures that date/time columns are properly classed for seamless
integration with other R functions.
}

The result is a clean, modern \code{tibble} that is fully compatible with the
tidyverse ecosystem.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Define the path to the example database included with the package
  db_path <- system.file("extdata", "biolife.db", package = "Rparadox")

  # Open the file handle. This also automatically attaches the .mb file.
  pxdoc <- pxlib_open_file(db_path)

  # Ensure the file was opened successfully before proceeding
  if (!is.null(pxdoc)) {
    # Read all data from the file into a tibble
    biolife_data <- pxlib_get_data(pxdoc)

    # It's good practice to close the file handle when done
    pxlib_close_file(pxdoc)

    # Now you can work with the data
    print(biolife_data)

    # Example of using the data with dplyr:
    # library(dplyr)
    # biolife_data \%>\%
    #   filter(Length_cm > 200) \%>\%
    #   select(Common_Name, Length_cm)
  }
}
